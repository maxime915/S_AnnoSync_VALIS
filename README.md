# S_AnnoSync_VALIS

Cytomine (<https://cytomine.org>) demo app developed by ULi√®ge Cytomine Research team (<https://uliege.cytomine.org>) for image registration, using the VALIS (Virtual Alignment of pathoLogy Image Series ) library (<https://github.com/MathOnco/valis>) by [Gatenbee et al. 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.09.467917v1).

This implementation follows Cytomine (=v3.0) external app conventions based on container technology.

The registration algorithm is implemented by VALIS (see <https://valis.readthedocs.org>).
